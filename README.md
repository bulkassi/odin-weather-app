# odin-todo-list

This project was created as part of The Odin Project curriculum. It involved developing a weather forecast application for displaying forecasts of different cities. Currently only English names of the cities are accepted as input, . All weather forecasts are provided by the Visual Crossing API, the introduction to which is used as a learning step of working with external APIs. Like the [Todo list project](https://github.com/bulkassi/odin-todo-list), the `date-fns` package is used for processing dates in Russian format. 

Main purpose of developing this application is to get introduced to asynchronous coding and `Promise`s feature of JS (including `async` and `await`), and using it for working with external API.
